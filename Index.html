		<h1>Hi, I'm Fateh!</h1>

		<h2>Where I'm from...</h2>
		<p>I was born and brought up in India until the age of 9, before I moved to Canada with my family in 2005. London was the city we first moved to upon immigrating to Canada and we've been living here ever since! </p>

		<h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
		<p>I have always been a fairly active person so I enjoy most sports, with basketball and soccer being my favourites. I still play quite quite often, however the frequency has slowed down greatly since school started in september.</p>

		<p>When I'm inside (as I was more so than any previous summer because of the lockdown) I like to make draw, paint and make music.</p>
